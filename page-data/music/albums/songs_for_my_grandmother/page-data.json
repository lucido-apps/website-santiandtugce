In this letter I thanked them both for their endless love and kindness and promised them that one day, I too would take care of them and make sure they were “in good hands”.\nAround the time of my college graduation, my grandmother suddenly got very sick and I knew the time had come to deliver my promise. During the days of her struggle with cancer and my grandfather’s subsequent illness, triggered mainly by his sadness for witnessing her gradual decay, I was very fortunate I could be near them till the very end.\nToday, in the 10th anniversary of the departure of both my grandparents from this world, I decided to dedicate this EP to their memory. The time I wrote my first letter for my grandparents happens to coincide with the time I started singing. So, I consider this album a love letter of sorts. It consists of some of my grandmother’s favorite songs. Each time one of these songs appeared on TV or the radio, my grandmother would almost always sing along, hence the title of the album: “Songs for my Grandmother”.\n- Tuğçe Kurtiş","lyrics":null,"credits":"Vocals: Tuğçe Kurtiş\nProduction: Santi & Tuğçe\nMix and Master: Santi\nAlbum Cover: Scott Partridge\n","links":{"beatport":"https://www.beatport.com/release/y-ld-zlar-n-alt-nda/2627815","bandcamp":"https://santiandtugce.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-my-grandmother-remixes-2","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/39Z3F5JtCMmq7FtPhvugkr","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/souqrecordss/sets/tug-c-e-kurtis-songs-for-my-2","itunes":"https://music.apple.com/album/yıldızların-altında/1468135730","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxJPT97J2smKx7uDq2crsxbGE8Ga8VBW_","deezer":null},"bandcampPlayer":{"url":"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1018979431/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\"","height":626}}}}
