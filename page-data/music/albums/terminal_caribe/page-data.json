Similar to their previous releases which take listeners on a sonic adventure all the way from the coasts of the Black Sea to the Parana River, Terminal Caribe presents a peculiarly personal, yet undoubtedly universal odyssey exploring the deep interrelations between music, movement, and memory. Named after a bus stop where the duo had the initial inkling for this album, Terminal Caribe serves as the point of departure for an entrancing journey through a wildly varied world of sound. Soulful melodies, captivating harmonies, colorful orchestration, polyrhyhmic percussions and marimbas, and deep bass lines combine with heartwarming vocals and the sounds of sea to tell a tale that is at once epic, melancholic, spacy and irresistibly groovy.","lyrics":null,"credits":"Original Tracks by: Santi & Tuğçe \nCover Art by: Scott Partridge, www.jevaart.com\n","links":{"beatport":null,"bandcamp":"https://santiandtugce.bandcamp.com/album/terminal-caribe","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/7F50uh7oGitmAEScRKV6pD","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/santiandtugce/sets/terminal-caribe","itunes":"https://music.apple.com/album/terminal-caribe/1466665067","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxJPT97J2smLpFSghoe9Z6DssvTl0_jNW","deezer":"https://www.deezer.com/us/album/99156642"},"bandcampPlayer":{"url":"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1723048316/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/transparent=true/","height":660}}}}
