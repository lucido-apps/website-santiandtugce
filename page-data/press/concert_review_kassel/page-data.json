Massive beats, which would have set every Berlin club in motion, went through the body, in the well-attended, but not sold-out, newly sold event hall of the Kulturzentrum Schlachthof in Kassel with about 200 guests. `Santi & Tugce feat. Flavien Porcu brought a world club feeling to Kassel from 23:00. With their massive bass line, virtuoso by Santi, alias Santiago Ferreira, created over and over again, combined with Spanish-South American to oriental-seeming elements, they brought the audience already with the first song on their side.\nThe vocals of Tugce Kurtis, at first glance quite traditional, became a techno-ethnic indulgence due to the unusual arrangement of the titles. The mood was brought to life by the gifted multi-percussionist Flavien Porcu, who accompanied `Santi & Tugce` in Kassel. With flying hands and a lightness that is rarely seen, the French Porcu created rousing rhythms over all styles of music. Many titles of the night can be heard on the recently released album `Punto Cero` by` Santi & Tugce`. If you like the music of the brothers Fritz and Paul Kalkbrenner or the beaty songs of Blank & Jones, you will appreciate this album as well.\nAlmost martial the beats of \"Orange\", which turned the hall into a dancefloor with their music. The club night has shown what's possible in the \"new\" cultural center Schlachthof. Technology, light and space are top - the best prerequisite for many addictive events, such as the World Music Festival. (zbp) (Â© Birgit Picht) "}}}
