The latter’s South American influences are ever so subtly present, creating a sound that globally-minded modern nomads can relate to as a multicultural anthem of our times’ mixing heritage. Songs for My Grandmother has been composed in memory of Tuğçe’s grandparents whose passing occurred exactly a decade before this release, prompting the conception of this EP which pays its dues through vocal covers of her elders’ favourite songs. Heartwarming sentiment indeed, and backed up with mature musicianship. "}}}
