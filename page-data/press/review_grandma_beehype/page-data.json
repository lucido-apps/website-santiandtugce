Well, maybe not so completely new because on this new effort she remakes three old Turkish songs – a bit like on her 2015 EP “Songs for Another Day” – but it all sounds as fresh as if it was born yesterday.\nFor the new EP, Tuğçe naturally teamed up with her longtime partner – Paraguay-born, US-based producer Santiago Ferreira also known as Santi – and once again we can call it a perfect pair, with 21st century dancefloor atmosphere mixed with the sounds of marimba, old synths and percussions.\n“In both of these albums, we drew upon many local characteristics and sounds associated with music from this region of the world, but we also infused them with unique elements to create a more contemporary, hybrid and dance-floor oriented sound,” Tuğçe wrote about this album.\n“This EP is dedicated to the memory of my grandparents,” she adds, “and it consists of some of her grandmother’s favorite songs.” "}}}
